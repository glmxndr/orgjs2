* Markup
  This section deals with the markup system.
  
  Orgjs differs from org-mode in that emphasis /can *be nested at*
  several levels/.

** Links
*** Bare links
    Some links in the markup can be interpreted as links if they start
    by a protocol definition: http:// is treated like a link.
*** Simple links
    Things surrounded by 2 =[= characters are treated as links as well.
    + =[[http://]]= is a link [[http://]]
*** Described links
    + 

** Verbatim
   You can have ~verbatim text~ and =code text= as well.
   
   Verbatim text can ~contain anything[fn:1]~, it won't be interpreted, like
   a ~link http://hegemonikon.com, see?~. Or other markup like 
** Emphasis
   + regular :: This is regular text.
   + emph :: This is /emphasized text/. 
   + strong :: This is *strong text*.
   + underline :: This is _underlined text_.
   + strike :: This is +striken-through text+.

** Embedding LaTeX
   We can have maths 
   + simple: $a+b^2=5$ like this, 
   + complex: $$ a-5x+14y=\alpha $$ like that, 
   + and even worse\( e^{i\pi}-1 = 0 \)like that.

** Misc
   This is markup for special things.
*** Horizontal line
    This line is above an horizontal line.
    -----
    This line is under an horizontal line.
